	abstract     = {Neural sequence-to-sequence models have provided a viable new approach for abstractive text summarization (meaning they are not restricted to simply selecting and rearranging passages from the original text). However, these models have two shortcomings: they are liable to reproduce factual details inaccurately, and they tend to repeat themselves. In this work we propose a novel architecture that augments the standard sequence-to-sequence attentional model in two orthogonal ways. First, we use a hybrid pointer-generator network that can copy words from the source text via pointing, which aids accurate reproduction of information, while retaining the ability to produce novel words through the generator. Second, we use coverage to keep track of what has been summarized, which discourages repetition. We apply our model to the CNN / Daily Mail summarization task, outperforming the current abstractive state-of-the-art by at least 2 ROUGE points.}

Query log analysis has emerged as one of the most promising research areas to automatically derive such structures. We explore a biologically inspired model based on ant colony optimisation applied to query logs as an adaptive learning process that addresses the problem of deriving query suggestions. A user interaction with the search engine is treated as an individual ant's journey and over time the collective journeys of all ants result in strengthening more popular paths which leads to a corresponding term association graph that is used to provide query modification suggestions. This association graph is being updated in a continuous learning cycle. In this paper we use a novel automatic evaluation framework based on actual query logs to explore the effect of different parameters in the ant colony optimisation algorithm on the performance of the resulting adaptive query suggestion model. We also use the framework to compare the ant colony approach against a state-of-the-art baseline. The experiments were conducted with query logs collected on a university search engine over a period of several years.},

Existing methods usually suggest terms based on statistics in documents as well as query logs and external dictionaries, and they neglect the fact that the topic information is very crucial because it helps retrieve topically relevant documents. To give users gratification, we propose a novel term suggestion method: as the user types in queries letter by letter, we suggest the terms that are topically coherent with the query and could retrieve relevant documents instantly. For effectively suggesting highly relevant terms, we propose a generative model by incorporating the topical coherence of terms. The model learns the topics from the underlying documents based on Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). For achieving the goal of instant query suggestion, we use a trie structure to index and access terms. We devise an efficient top-k algorithm to suggest terms as users type in queries. Experimental results show that our approach not only improves the effectiveness of term suggestion, but also achieves better efficiency and scalability.},

Two techniques, term relevance feedback and query suggestion, provide methods to help users formulate queries, but each is limited in different ways. In this research we combine these two techniques by automatically creating query suggestions using term relevance feedback techniques. To evaluate our approach, we conducted an interactive information retrieval study with 55 subjects and 20 topics. Each subject completed four topics, half with a term suggestion system and half with a query suggestion system. We also investigated the source of the suggestions: approximately half of all subjects were provided with system-generated suggestions, while half were provided with user-generated suggestions. Results show that subjects used more query suggestions than term suggestions and saved more documents with these suggestions, even though there were no significant differences in performance. Subjects preferred the query suggestion system and rated it higher along a number of dimensions including its ability to help them think of new approaches to searching. Qualitative data provided insight into subjects' usage and ratings, and indicated that subjects often used the suggestions even when they did not click on them.},

Although these tasks have received much attention in the web search literature, the Twitter context introduces a real-time "twist": after significant breaking news events, we aim to provide relevant results within minutes. This paper provides a case study illustrating the challenges of real-time data processing in the era of "big data". We tell the story of how our system was built twice: our first implementation was built on a typical Hadoop-based analytics stack, but was later replaced because it did not meet the latency requirements necessary to generate meaningful real-time results. The second implementation, which is the system deployed in production, is a custom in-memory processing engine specifically designed for the task. This experience taught us that the current typical usage of Hadoop as a "big data" platform, while great for experimentation, is not well suited to low-latency processing, and points the way to future work on data analytics platforms that can handle "big" as well as "fast" data.},

In this article we argue that eye-movement data provide an excellent on-line indication of the cognitive processes underlying visual search and reading. We outline some recent advances from physiological investigations of saccadic eye-movement control before focusing on eye-movement behaviour in visual search and reading studies. We consider factors that can affect the duration of fixations and the choice of saccade targets, emphasising continuities between biological and cognitive descriptions. We discuss different ways of measuring cognitive processing time from an eye-movement record and the relationship between attention and eye movements.},

	abstract     = {Passage retrieval and ranking is a key task in open-domain question answering and information retrieval. Current effective approaches mostly rely on pre-trained deep language model-based retrievers and rankers. These methods have been shown to effectively model the semantic matching between queries and passages, also in presence of keyword mismatch, i.e. passages that are relevant to a query but do not contain important query keywords. In this paper we consider the Dense Retriever (DR), a passage retrieval method, and the BERT re-ranker, a popular passage re-ranking method. In this context, we formally investigate how these models respond and adapt to a specific type of keyword mismatch {--} that caused by keyword typos occurring in queries. Through empirical investigation, we find that typos can lead to a significant drop in retrieval and ranking effectiveness. We then propose a simple typos-aware training framework for DR and BERT re-ranker to address this issue. Our experimental results on the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset show that, with our proposed typos-aware training, DR and BERT re-ranker can become robust to typos in queries, resulting in significantly improved effectiveness compared to models trained without appropriately accounting for typos.}

	abstract     = {We introduce a new language representation model called BERT, which stands for Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers. Unlike recent language representation models (Peters et al., 2018a; Radford et al., 2018), BERT is designed to pre-train deep bidirectional representations from unlabeled text by jointly conditioning on both left and right context in all layers. As a result, the pre-trained BERT model can be fine-tuned with just one additional output layer to create state-of-the-art models for a wide range of tasks, such as question answering and language inference, without substantial task-specific architecture modifications. BERT is conceptually simple and empirically powerful. It obtains new state-of-the-art results on eleven natural language processing tasks, including pushing the GLUE score to 80.5 (7.7 point absolute improvement), MultiNLI accuracy to 86.7{\%} (4.6{\%} absolute improvement), SQuAD v1.1 question answering Test F1 to 93.2 (1.5 point absolute improvement) and SQuAD v2.0 Test F1 to 83.1 (5.1 point absolute improvement).}

	abstract     = {Optimizing convolutional neural networks for fast inference has recently become an extremely active area of research. One of the go-to solutions in this context is weight pruning, which aims to reduce computational and memory footprint by removing large subsets of the connections in a neural network. Surprisingly, much less attention has been given to exploiting sparsity in the activation maps, which tend to be naturally sparse in many settings thanks to the structure of rectified linear (ReLU) activation functions. In this paper, we present an in-depth analysis of methods for maximizing the sparsity of the activations in a trained neural network, and show that, when coupled with an efficient sparse-input convolution algorithm, we can leverage this sparsity for significant performance gains. To induce highly sparse activation maps without accuracy loss, we introduce a new regularization technique, coupled with a new threshold-based sparsification method based on a parameterized activation function called Forced-Activation-Threshold Rectified Linear Unit (FATReLU). We examine the impact of our methods on popular image classification models, showing that most architectures can adapt to significantly sparser activation maps without any accuracy loss. Our second contribution is showing that these these compression gains can be translated into inference speedups: we provide a new algorithm to enable fast convolution operations over networks with sparse activations, and show that it can enable significant speedups for end-to-end inference on a range of popular models on the large-scale ImageNet image classification task on modern Intel CPUs, with little or no retraining cost.}
